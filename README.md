# Automatically sort media files on a WD My Cloud NAS with Incron

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
WD My Cloud is a NAS with a web access provided by Western Digital.
As it is, it is a great storing device for your media center
(eg : https://kodi.tv/) but it can become a repetitive task to find
the right path, in your library, in which to store each newly
downloaded TV show episode or movie. Although, the My Cloud runs
under a modified version of Debian so it can be tweaked to suit
our needs. So we can add the feature to automatically sort any
media files dropped into a given directory to their right path in
the library.

<h2>Disclaimer :</h2>
<p>
The modification you may do after using SSH to log into your WD My
Cloud may void its warranty and I won't take any responsibility
over that. This tutorial is only for an informative purpose.<br/>
<b>The firmware version on the WD My Cloud that has been used for
this project is v04.04.02-105 and this setup won't function on
earlier builds.</b>
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<h3>Step 1 : Enable SSH access to My Cloud</h3>
<p>
Before doing any modification you must make sure they won't be
erased by the next automatic firmware update, to do so, go in your
web browser, open http://wdmycloud.local and log in. Then :<br/>
&nbsp;<b>Toggle off : Settings > Firmware > Auto Update > Enable
Auto Update </b><br/>
</p>
<p>
From that same page, you must enable SSH access :<br/>
&nbsp;<b>Toggle on : Settings > Network Services > SSH</b>
</p>
Then from your terminal : <br/>
&nbsp;<b>ssh root@wdmycloud.local</b><br/>
The default password is welc0me, you should change it once your are
logged in.
</p>

<h3>Step 2 : Install Incron and its dependencies</h3>
<p>
Still in your terminal, SSH as root in your My Cloud :<br/>
&nbsp;<b>git clone git://github.com/SylvainRX/WDMyCloud_MediaSorter.git</b><br/>
&nbsp;<b>chmod -R 700 WDMyCloud_MediaSorter</b><br/>
&nbsp;<b>cd WDMyCloud_MediaSorter/incron_bin</b><br/>
&nbsp;<b>./install.sh</b><br/>
</p>

<h3>Step 3 : Setup the file sorting script</h3>
<p>
Still as root in your My Cloud, create a directory under
"/shares/YourShare/repository" which will be the repository for the
sorting algorithm to watch in for newly added media files :<br/>
&nbsp;<b>mkdir /shares/YourShare/repository</b><br/>
&nbsp;<b>chmod 777 /shares/YourShare/repository</b><br/>
</p>
<p>
Then create a directory to put in the script files :<br/>
&nbsp;<b>mkdir /root/.incron</b><br/>
&nbsp;<b>cd ../sortmedia_scripts</b><br/>
&nbsp;<b>mv * /root/.incron</b><br/>
&nbsp;<b>cd ../..</b><br/>
&nbsp;<b>rm -rf WDMyCloud_MediaSorter</b><br/>
</p>
<p>
You need to edit sortmedias.sh in order to specify where are your
TV show and movie libraries :<br/>
&nbsp;<b>nano /root/.incron/sortmedias.sh</b><br/>
Edit the following lines in the opened file so the path are right :
<br/>
&nbsp;<b>PATH_TVSHOWS='/DataVolume/shares/YourShare/TV Shows'</b>
<br/>
&nbsp;<b>PATH_MOVIES='/DataVolume/shares/YourShare/Movies'</b><br/>
Save and exit.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you need to set up incron to watch for events happening in
your repository :<br/>
&nbsp;<b>incrontab -e</b><br/>
Add the following line in the opened file :<br/>
&nbsp;<b>"/path/to/your/repository" IN_CREATE,IN_MOVED_TO,IN_ISDIR
"/path/to/this/script/sortmedias.sh" $# $@ $% $&</b><br/>
Save and exit.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Make sure incron is running :<br/>
&nbsp;<b>/etc/init.d/incron start</b><br/>
</p>
<p>
Your WD My Cloud should now be able to sort any files or directory
of files dropped into /shares/YourShare/repository. You can further
edit sortmedias.sh to specify a directory in which write a log file
and a trash directory to move unsorted files into.<br/>
I have made this sorting algorithm in a way that the bittorrent
client Transmission can also drop its downloaded files into the
sorting repository and have them sorted automatically.
